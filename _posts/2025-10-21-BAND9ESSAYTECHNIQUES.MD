# IELTS Writing Task 2 — Opinion Essay (Band 9 Model + Techniques)

---

## Example Question
> Some people believe that governments should invest more in public transportation,  
> while others think money should be spent on improving roads for private vehicles.  
> To what extent do you agree or disagree?

---

## Introduction

Rarely has modern urban life required such careful balance between **public accessibility** and **private convenience**.  
While supporters of **public transport investment** argue that it reduces pollution and congestion, advocates of **road expansion** contend that it supports economic growth.  
This essay argues that **funding public transportation** is **more beneficial**, provided that **it remains efficient and affordable**.

### Techniques Used
- **Inversion (“Rarely has…”)** → formal emphasis and advanced word order.  
- **Parallel structure (“supporters of… / advocates of…”)** → rhythm and cohesion.  
- **Hedged thesis (“provided that…”)** → academic caution and nuance.  
- **Nominalisation (investment, accessibility, convenience)** → formal tone.  
- **No personal pronouns** → maintains objective register.

---

## Body 1 — Supporting View (C-E-E-R)

Not only do **public transport systems** reduce **traffic congestion**, but they also **decrease air pollution**.  
They **raise the efficiency of cities** by **moving large numbers of people at lower cost**.  
When **well-maintained**, such systems can **improve productivity and social inclusion**.  
Nevertheless, **investment alone** can **fail to deliver results** if **planning and maintenance** are weak.

### Techniques Used
- **Inversion (“Not only do… but they also…”)** → formal emphasis.  
- **Cause–effect with “by + -ing”** → clear logical connection.  
- **Reduced clause (“When well-maintained”)** → concise participial form.  
- **Contrast clause (“Nevertheless… if…”)** → balanced reasoning.  
- **Lexical cohesion (investment, systems, inclusion)** → topic unity.

---

## Body 2 — Counter-View + Rebuttal (C-E-E-R + Having-Step)

By contrast, **road improvement projects** may appear attractive because they **support private mobility** and **business logistics**.  
However, such policies often **encourage more car use**, turning **short-term relief** into **long-term congestion**.  
**Having prioritised roads for decades**, many cities now **face rising fuel consumption and environmental decline**.  
Crucially, **pairing** limited road upgrades **with better transit** **promotes balance** while **preserving sustainability**.

### Techniques Used
- **Contrast signal (“By contrast”)** → smooth shift between arguments.  
- **Parallel nouns (“short-term relief / long-term congestion”)** → stylistic rhythm.  
- **Perfect participial clause (“Having prioritised…”)** → shows prior cause.  
- **Gerund subject (“pairing… with…”)** → fluent academic syntax.  
- **Balanced adjectives (“better / limited / sustainable”)** → precision of tone.

---

## Conclusion (Cleft Focus)

It is not **road expansion** but **efficient public transport** that **ensures sustainable cities**.  
Where **over-reliance on cars** **risks pollution and delay**, **investment in shared systems** **remains fair, modern, and effective**.

### Techniques Used
- **Cleft sentence (“It is not X but Y that…”)** → elegant closure.  
- **Adverbial ‘where’ clause** → conditional contrast for fluency.  
- **Parallel adjectives (“fair, modern, effective”)** → symmetry and rhythm.  
- **Nominal repetition (“investment / systems”)** → cohesive end.  
- **Formal impersonal tone** → academic conclusion.

---

# IELTS Writing Task 2 — Discussion Essay (Band 9 Model + Techniques)

---

## Example Question
> Some people believe that remote work increases productivity,  
> while others argue that it reduces collaboration.  
> Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

---

## Introduction

Rarely has the global workplace changed as dramatically as it has in the last decade.  
While supporters of **remote work** argue that it allows flexibility and greater focus, advocates of **traditional offices** contend that it preserves teamwork and company culture.  
This essay argues that **remote work** is **more productive overall**, provided that **communication tools are used effectively**.

### Techniques Used
- **Inversion (“Rarely has…”)** → formal, striking opening.  
- **Parallel clauses (“supporters of / advocates of …”)** → balanced tone.  
- **Hedged thesis (“provided that …”)** → academic caution.  
- **Nominalisation (change → transformation, collaboration)** → formal style.  
- **No personal pronouns** → objective, impersonal voice.

---

## Body 1 — First View (Traditional Offices) (C-E-E-R)

Not only do **traditional office spaces** create **a sense of community**, but they also **enable instant problem-solving through face-to-face interaction**.  
They **raise collaboration efficiency** by **allowing quick clarification and team bonding**.  
When **employees share physical space**, they can **learn informally from one another**.  
Nevertheless, **rigid office schedules** can **limit autonomy**, which is why **a fully office-based model** may not suit every worker.

### Techniques Used
- **Inversion (“Not only do … but also …”)** → Band-9 grammar variety.  
- **Cause–effect with “by + -ing”** → explicit logical mechanism.  
- **Reduced clause (“When employees share space”)** → concise participial phrase.  
- **Contrast connector (“Nevertheless … which is why …”)** → cohesive reasoning.  
- **Lexical cohesion** → words like *interaction, bonding, collaboration* unify paragraph.

---

## Body 2 — Second View (Remote Work + Your Opinion) (C-E-E-R + Having-Step)

By contrast, **remote work** **builds productivity** through **flexible scheduling and fewer distractions**.  
Transparent **digital tracking systems** convert **time spent** into **clear results**.  
**Having adopted hybrid policies**, many firms have **recorded higher output and employee satisfaction**.  
Crucially, **pairing** remote options **with regular team meetings** **encourages accountability** while **preserving collaboration**.

### Techniques Used
- **Transition signal (“By contrast”)** → smooth shift to new stance.  
- **Parallel nouns (“time spent / clear results”)** → rhythmic cohesion.  
- **Perfect participial clause (“Having adopted …”)** → shows prior cause.  
- **Gerund subject (“pairing … with …”)** → fluent academic syntax.  
- **Balanced adjectives (“higher output / employee satisfaction”)** → lexical precision.

---

## Conclusion (Cleft Focus)

It is not **physical presence** but **effective communication** that **sustains productivity**.  
Where **isolation risks misunderstanding**, **digital coordination** **remains efficient and inclusive**.

### Techniques Used
- **Cleft sentence (“It is not X but Y that …”)** → focuses final argument.  
- **‘Where’ clause** → conditional contrast adds sophistication.  
- **Parallel adjectives (“efficient and inclusive”)** → balanced tone.  
- **Repetition of key lexis (productivity / communication)** → coherence.  
- **Formal register** → objective closure.

---

## Grammar & Lexical Explanation Table

| Feature | Example | Explanation |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Inversion** | Rarely has the global workplace changed … | Highlights change formally. |
| **Cleft sentence** | It is not presence but communication … | Focus structure for summary. |
| **Nominalisation** | collaboration, productivity, autonomy | Academic lexis. |
| **Participial clause** | Having adopted hybrid policies … | Shows cause–effect concisely. |
| **Modal verbs / hedging** | may not suit / can limit / should combine | Adds balance and formality. |
| **Logical connectors** | By contrast / Nevertheless | Cohesion across ideas. |
| **Parallelism** | efficient and inclusive | Smooth rhythm and clarity. |

---

## Adaptation Notes

To reuse this template:
- Replace *remote work / traditional office* with any two contrasting ideas (e.g., *online learning vs classroom study*, *renewable vs nuclear energy*).  
- Keep **“Rarely has …”** in the introduction and **“It is not … but …”** in the conclusion for Band-9 sentence variety.  
- Maintain C-E-E-R structure in each body paragraph.  
- Use one perfect participial clause (“Having + V3”) and one contrast transition (“By contrast” / “Nevertheless”).

---

## Example Question
> Many cities today face serious traffic congestion.  
> What are the main problems caused by traffic congestion, and what solutions can be implemented?

---

## Introduction

Rarely has **urban growth** produced such visible strain on modern transportation systems.  
While heavy traffic is often viewed as an unavoidable sign of progress, it increasingly threatens **public health and economic productivity**.  
This essay argues that **traffic congestion** can be effectively reduced through **better public transport and policy regulation**, provided that **governments act consistently**.

### Techniques Used
- **Inversion (“Rarely has…”)** → formal, attention-grabbing opener.  
- **Contrastive phrase (“While heavy traffic is often viewed…”)** → balanced framing.  
- **Nominalisation (growth, transportation, productivity)** → academic precision.  
- **Hedged thesis (“provided that…”)** → conditional stance for sophistication.  
- **No personal pronouns** → formal tone.

---

## Body 1 — Problems (C-E-E-R)

Not only does **traffic congestion** create **long commuting hours**, but it also **intensifies pollution and stress**.  
It **reduces workforce productivity** by **causing delays and fatigue**.  
When **roads remain clogged for long periods**, the **economic cost** can **rise dramatically** due to wasted fuel and lost time.  
Nevertheless, **these issues** can **be mitigated** once **systemic reforms** are introduced.

### Techniques Used
- **Inversion (“Not only does… but also…”)** → advanced emphasis.  
- **Cause–effect structure (“by + -ing”)** → logical explanation.  
- **Reduced clause (“When roads remain clogged”)** → participial concision.  
- **Modal passive (“can be mitigated”)** → formal and cautious tone.  
- **Lexical cohesion** → repetition of *productivity / cost / pollution* links ideas.

---

## Body 2 — Solutions (C-E-E-R + Having-Step)

By contrast, **improved public transportation** and **smart traffic management** **offer practical remedies**.  
Cities can **lessen congestion** by **expanding subway lines and regulating private vehicle use**.  
**Having introduced congestion charges**, cities like London have **seen measurable reductions in car traffic**.  
Crucially, **pairing** infrastructure upgrades **with public awareness campaigns** **encourages sustainable travel** while **preserving accessibility**.

### Techniques Used
- **Transition (“By contrast”)** → clear signal of shift from problems to solutions.  
- **Parallel noun phrases (“public transportation / traffic management”)** → rhythm.  
- **Perfect participial clause (“Having introduced…”)** → illustrates prior success.  
- **Gerund subject (“pairing upgrades with campaigns”)** → fluent and formal syntax.  
- **Balanced adjectives (“sustainable / accessible”)** → academic tone.

---

## Conclusion (Cleft Focus)

> What are the causes of this trend, and what solutions can be implemented to reduce the problem?

---

## Introduction

Rarely has **rural migration** occurred at such a rapid and widespread scale.  
While some movement towards cities is natural in developing economies, the current pace threatens **rural sustainability and urban overcrowding**.  
This essay argues that **economic inequality and lack of opportunity** are the **main causes**, and that **investment in rural education and infrastructure** offers the **most effective solutions**, provided that **governments implement long-term policies**.
