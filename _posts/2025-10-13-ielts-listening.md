## 🧠 Key IELTS Listening Tricks

### 🎯 1. Predict Before You Listen
- Read the questions before the recording starts.
- Underline keywords (names, numbers, dates).
- Predict the type of answer (noun, number, address, etc.).

> Example:  
> “The booking reference number is ___.”  
> ➜ Expect a mix of letters and numbers.

---

### 🔄 2. Listen for Paraphrasing
The test rarely uses the exact words from the question.

Question: “The hotel provides free breakfast.”  
Audio: “Breakfast is included in the price.”  
✅ Both mean the same — that’s your answer!

👉 Build your synonym awareness through practice.

---

### ⚠️ 3. Beware of Traps
Speakers often change or correct information.

Audio Example:
> “Take bus number 42 — sorry, it’s been changed to 43.”

✅ Correct Answer: 43

> 🧭 Tip: Don’t write the first thing you hear. Wait till the speaker finishes the sentence.

---

### ⏱️ 4. Questions Follow Audio Order
- Answers come in the same sequence as the recording.
- If you miss one, don’t panic — move on.
- Guess logically and keep listening for the next clue.

---

### ⌛ 5. Manage Your Time Smartly
- Before audio: Scan and predict.
- During: Focus and listen for key words.
- After: Transfer and check grammar/spelling.

💻 For computer-based tests, you get 2 extra minutes to review answers.

## 🗂️ Common Question Types & Strategies

| Type | What to Do |
|------|-------------|
| Form/Note Completion | Expect short factual answers; focus on spelling. |
| Multiple Choice (A/B/C) | Eliminate options as you listen; beware of paraphrasing. |
| Map/Plan Labelling | Learn direction words: *next to, opposite, behind*. Visualize the map. |
| Sentence Completion | Match grammar — answer must fit grammatically. |
| Matching | Link people/ideas; speakers often paraphrase heavily. |

---

## ✍️ Grammar & Spelling Rules

- Spelling must be correct or it’s marked wrong.
- Use CAPITAL LETTERS for clarity.
- Prefer British spellings (e.g., *colour*, *centre*).
- Check word limit:
  - “NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS” → 3 words = ❌

---

- British
- Australian

🎧 Improve by:

## 💡 Hidden Tricks Used by Top Scorers

### 🪄 A. Anticipate Grammar
If the question says:
> “The main reason for the visit was __.”

➜ Expect a noun phrase, not a number or verb.

---

### 🎵 B. Listen for Tone Changes
Tone often signals corrections or emphasis.

> “Actually, it’s on Friday, not Thursday.”  
⚠️ Be alert — the second phrase is usually correct.

---

### 📏 C. Check Word Limits & Plurals
Follow the instructions exactly.  
“NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS” = up to 2 words only.

Plural mistakes also cost marks:  
> “Ticket” ≠ “Tickets”
