📘 IELTS Reading Practice – Passage 1
Question Type: Matching Headings
Title: The Story of Plastic

(Approx. 750 words — IELTS Academic difficulty)

Reading Passage

Paragraph A
Plastic, one of the most widely used materials in the modern world, was first created in the early 20th century. The word “plastic” originally referred to any material that could be molded or shaped. Early forms, like Bakelite, were celebrated for their flexibility, durability, and resistance to heat. These characteristics soon made plastics essential in industries ranging from electronics to fashion.

Paragraph B
After World War II, plastic production expanded rapidly. Manufacturers found ways to produce it cheaply and in large quantities. This democratized many goods: people who could not afford metal, glass, or wood alternatives suddenly had access to affordable, lightweight products. From toys to furniture and kitchenware, plastic became a symbol of post-war progress and consumer convenience.

Paragraph C
However, the very features that made plastic so successful also created long-term problems. Unlike organic materials, most plastics do not decompose naturally. A single plastic bottle can last for hundreds of years in the environment. As global consumption increased, so did the accumulation of plastic waste in landfills and oceans.

Paragraph D
In the 1970s, scientists began to raise concerns about the environmental cost of plastic. Studies revealed large amounts of plastic debris floating in the ocean, harming marine life. Turtles, for instance, often mistake plastic bags for jellyfish and die from choking. Birds and fish have been found with fragments of plastic in their stomachs. This began to shift public perception from plastic as a “miracle material” to a growing environmental threat.

Paragraph E
In response, recycling programs emerged in many developed countries. Governments encouraged citizens to separate waste, and new symbols such as the triangular recycling logo became familiar. However, recycling was not the perfect solution people hoped for. Only a small percentage of collected plastic could actually be reused due to contamination or material limitations.

Paragraph F
Recently, scientists and engineers have sought innovative ways to reduce plastic pollution. Some have developed biodegradable plastics made from plant starches that can break down faster under the right conditions. Others promote a circular economy model — where products are designed to be reused or repurposed indefinitely rather than thrown away.

Paragraph G
Despite these efforts, plastic remains deeply embedded in modern society. Its low cost, versatility, and strength continue to make it the preferred material for countless industries. The challenge now is to balance human convenience with environmental responsibility. Solving the plastic problem will require not only technological innovation but also a shift in consumer behavior and global policy.

It’s written in authentic IELTS Academic style (~800 words), with 10 questions, answers, and full explanations.

📘 IELTS Reading Practice – Passage 2
Question Type: Matching Paragraph Information
Title: Coral Reefs: Rainforests of the Sea
Reading Passage

Paragraph A
Coral reefs are among the most diverse ecosystems on Earth, often referred to as the “rainforests of the sea.” They occupy less than one percent of the ocean floor yet support nearly a quarter of all marine species. From colorful fish and sea turtles to tiny microorganisms, reefs are home to countless forms of life that depend on them for shelter, food, and breeding grounds.

Paragraph B
Coral itself is not a plant but a living organism made up of tiny animals called polyps. These polyps build calcium carbonate skeletons, which form the structure of the reef. Within each polyp lives a microscopic algae known as zooxanthellae. This symbiotic relationship benefits both partners: the algae provide energy through photosynthesis, while the coral offers protection and access to sunlight.

Paragraph C
Coral reefs provide vital benefits not only for marine species but also for humans. They act as natural barriers that protect coastlines from storms, erosion, and flooding. Additionally, they contribute billions of dollars annually to the global economy through tourism, fishing, and pharmaceutical research. Some modern medicines for cancer and viral infections have been derived from reef organisms.

Paragraph D
However, coral reefs are increasingly under threat. Rising sea temperatures caused by climate change have led to a phenomenon known as coral bleaching. When the water becomes too warm, corals expel the algae living in their tissues, turning completely white. Although bleached coral is not immediately dead, prolonged stress can kill it, leaving behind a skeleton that cannot sustain marine life.

Paragraph E
Another major danger to coral reefs is ocean acidification, caused by the absorption of carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere. As CO₂ dissolves in seawater, it forms carbonic acid, lowering the pH of the ocean. This process weakens coral skeletons and slows their growth. Scientists warn that if carbon emissions continue to rise, some reefs may cease to grow altogether by the end of the century.

Paragraph F
Human activities also play a significant role in reef destruction. Overfishing, coastal development, and pollution from agriculture all contribute to reef decline. Sediment and chemicals carried by rivers reduce sunlight penetration and suffocate coral polyps. Meanwhile, destructive fishing techniques, such as dynamite and cyanide fishing, can annihilate entire reef systems within moments.

Paragraph G
Conservation efforts are underway around the world to save coral reefs. Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been established to restrict fishing and human interference in key zones. Artificial reefs are being constructed from concrete or old ships to provide new habitats for marine life. Educational programs encourage local communities and tourists to adopt sustainable practices such as responsible diving and waste management.

Paragraph H
Promisingly, some coral species have shown resilience to environmental stress. Scientists are studying these “super corals” to understand how they survive high temperatures and acidic conditions. This research may hold the key to restoring damaged reefs. Yet experts agree that reducing greenhouse gas emissions remains the most effective long-term solution for coral survival.

📘 IELTS Reading Practice – Passage 3
Question Type: Matching Features
Title: The Great Inventors: Shaping the Modern World
Reading Passage

Paragraph A – Thomas Edison (1847–1931)
Edison, one of the most prolific inventors in history, held over a thousand patents. His best-known contribution was the practical electric light bulb, which revolutionized the way people lived and worked after dark. However, Edison’s genius extended beyond illumination. He also invented the phonograph — the first device capable of recording and playing back sound — and developed early motion-picture cameras. What made Edison unique was his emphasis on teamwork: he built one of the first research laboratories, where scientists collaborated to develop commercial technologies.

Paragraph B – Nikola Tesla (1856–1943)
Tesla’s brilliance lay in his understanding of alternating current (AC) electricity, which became the global standard. While Edison promoted direct current (DC), Tesla’s system proved more efficient for transmitting power over long distances. He also pioneered wireless communication, remote control, and radio. Though many of his inventions were not financially successful during his lifetime, his work paved the way for modern electronics, including the wireless networks we depend on today.

Paragraph C – Alexander Graham Bell (1847–1922)
Bell is most famous for inventing the telephone, but his curiosity extended far beyond communication technology. Trained as a teacher for the deaf, he sought ways to improve speech and hearing. His experiments with sound waves led directly to the invention of the telephone in 1876. Later in life, Bell worked on aviation and hydrofoil boats. He also co-founded the National Geographic Society, helping promote science and education worldwide.

Paragraph D – Marie Curie (1867–1934)
Unlike the others, Curie’s achievements were rooted in the natural sciences rather than engineering. She and her husband Pierre Curie discovered two new elements, polonium and radium, pioneering the study of radioactivity — a term she coined herself. Her research laid the groundwork for medical treatments such as cancer radiotherapy. Marie Curie became the first person, and still the only woman, to win two Nobel Prizes in different scientific fields — Physics and Chemistry.

Paragraph E – Legacy and Impact
Although these inventors worked in different disciplines, their innovations share a common theme: they transformed daily life and continue to influence modern technology. Edison’s light, Tesla’s alternating current, Bell’s communication devices, and Curie’s discoveries in physics all serve as the foundation of industries that still power the world today.

It’s a full, IELTS-style reading passage (~780 words) with authentic question structure, answer key, and detailed strategies.

📘 IELTS Reading Practice – Passage 4
Question Type: Matching Sentence Endings
Title: The Rise of Artificial Intelligence
Reading Passage

Paragraph A
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems that can perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as understanding language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions. The concept dates back to the 1950s, when computer scientists began exploring whether machines could "think". Early attempts were limited by technology, but they laid the foundation for modern machine learning and data-driven computing.

Paragraph B
AI has become increasingly integrated into daily life. Smartphones use AI to recognize speech, online stores recommend products based on previous searches, and navigation apps predict traffic conditions. In medicine, AI helps doctors analyze scans more accurately, while in agriculture it assists farmers in monitoring crop health through satellite imagery. These examples demonstrate that AI is no longer a futuristic dream — it is already embedded in our routines.

Paragraph C
Despite its usefulness, AI also raises serious ethical and social concerns. As machines take over repetitive jobs, millions of workers risk being replaced. In customer service, manufacturing, and logistics, automated systems can now perform tasks once handled by humans. While this increases efficiency, it can also widen economic inequality if workers are not retrained for new roles.

Paragraph D
Privacy is another major issue. AI relies on vast amounts of data to learn and improve, meaning personal information such as location, search history, and facial features are constantly collected and analyzed. Critics argue that this could lead to mass surveillance and manipulation, especially when data is used by governments or corporations without consent.

Paragraph E
On the other hand, AI also holds promise for solving global challenges. Machine learning is being applied to climate models, helping scientists predict extreme weather and improve disaster response. In education, adaptive learning platforms personalize lessons to match each student’s pace and abilities, potentially transforming how people learn.

Paragraph F
The debate over AI’s impact often reflects broader questions about human identity. If machines can think, create art, and make decisions, what remains uniquely human? Some philosophers believe AI will force society to redefine intelligence itself, not as something exclusively human, but as a spectrum that includes machines.

This one targets one of the most common (and tricky) question types: True / False / Not Given.
It includes a realistic 750-word passage, 10 questions, and detailed reasoning for each answer.

📘 IELTS Reading Practice – Passage 5
Question Type: True / False / Not Given**
Title: The Urban Gardening Movement
Reading Passage

Paragraph A
Over the last two decades, cities around the world have witnessed a dramatic rise in urban gardening. From rooftop vegetable patches in New York to community allotments in London, citizens are transforming unused spaces into green oases. The movement began partly in response to growing concerns about food security, environmental sustainability, and the psychological effects of city living.

Paragraph B
Urban gardening provides several environmental benefits. Plants naturally absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, helping to reduce pollution levels. Rooftop gardens in particular can lower surrounding air temperatures and reduce the “urban heat island” effect. Moreover, when residents grow their own vegetables, it decreases the demand for imported food, thereby cutting down transportation emissions.

Paragraph C
Aside from environmental advantages, the practice also strengthens communities. Shared gardens bring together people from different backgrounds who might otherwise never interact. Studies in Canadian cities have shown that community gardeners often report higher levels of social trust and lower rates of crime in their neighborhoods. Gardening also encourages physical activity, which can improve overall health.

Paragraph D
However, the urban gardening trend faces several challenges. Limited space in dense cities restricts how much food can be produced. In many areas, contaminated soil poses a health risk, as it may contain heavy metals such as lead or mercury. Additionally, maintaining rooftop gardens can be expensive, requiring specialized waterproofing and structural support to handle the extra weight.

Paragraph E
Despite these challenges, technology is helping to make urban gardening more efficient. Hydroponic and vertical farming systems allow crops to grow indoors without soil, using nutrient-rich water instead. Some entrepreneurs are turning old warehouses into indoor farms illuminated by LED lights. Although these projects require significant investment, they offer a glimpse of how cities might produce food sustainably in the future.

Paragraph F
Experts believe that urban gardening will never replace traditional agriculture, but it can complement it. By providing local, fresh produce and reconnecting people with nature, city gardens help create a more resilient and environmentally conscious society. The key to their success lies in community involvement and public support from local governments.

Questions 1–10
Do the following statements agree with the information in the passage?

Write:

TRUE if the statement agrees with the passage.

FALSE if the statement contradicts the passage.

NOT GIVEN if there is no information on this.

Urban gardening started mainly because of population growth in rural areas.

Rooftop gardens can help reduce heat in cities.

📘 IELTS Reading Practice – Passage 6
Question Type: Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)
Title: The Human Brain and Memory
Reading Passage

Paragraph A
The human brain, weighing about 1.4 kilograms, is often described as the most complex structure in the known universe. It contains approximately 86 billion neurons — specialized cells that transmit information through electrical and chemical signals. Memory, one of the brain’s most remarkable functions, enables humans to store, retrieve, and use information. Without it, learning, communication, and even personal identity would be impossible.

Paragraph B
Scientists generally divide memory into three main stages: encoding, storage, and retrieval. Encoding refers to the process of converting sensory input — such as sights, sounds, and smells — into a form that can be stored. Once encoded, information moves into short-term memory, which holds it temporarily for a few seconds or minutes. Through repetition or emotional significance, some information transfers into long-term memory, where it can remain for years or even a lifetime.

Paragraph C
Research has revealed that different parts of the brain handle different types of memory. The hippocampus, located deep in the temporal lobe, plays a key role in forming new memories. The amygdala attaches emotional meaning to experiences, explaining why people tend to remember emotionally charged events more vividly. Meanwhile, procedural memory — such as knowing how to ride a bicycle or play an instrument — depends on the cerebellum and basal ganglia.

Paragraph D
Not all memories are accurate. In fact, the human brain is prone to distortion. Each time a memory is recalled, it is reconstructed rather than replayed like a recording. This reconstruction process means memories can change subtly over time. Psychologists such as Elizabeth Loftus have demonstrated how easily people can form false memories through suggestion. In experiments, participants were convinced they had seen nonexistent objects or experienced events that never occurred.

Paragraph E
Modern technology has transformed the study of memory. Brain imaging techniques like functional MRI (fMRI) allow scientists to observe which regions activate when people recall specific information. These studies show that memory is not confined to a single location but distributed across various networks. Interestingly, memories are not stored like digital files; rather, they are patterns of activity that can be strengthened or weakened by experience.

Paragraph F
Memory decline is a natural part of aging, but severe deterioration may indicate conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease. This disorder involves the buildup of abnormal proteins in the brain that damage neurons and disrupt communication between them. While there is currently no cure, treatments aim to slow cognitive decline and improve quality of life. Lifestyle factors such as exercise, social interaction, and mental stimulation are believed to help maintain brain health.

Paragraph G
Recent research into neuroplasticity — the brain’s ability to reorganize itself — has brought new hope. Scientists now know that the adult brain can form new neural connections, even in old age. Activities like learning a new language or musical instrument stimulate the brain, strengthening existing pathways and creating new ones. This adaptability may hold the key to preventing or even reversing memory loss in the future.

Question Type: List of Options
Title: Types of Volcanoes and Their Behavior
Reading Passage

Paragraph A
Volcanoes are openings in the Earth’s crust through which molten rock, gas, and ash escape. They form where tectonic plates meet or diverge, allowing magma from beneath the surface to reach the air. Over millions of years, volcanic activity has shaped continents, created islands, and influenced the climate. Although often seen as destructive, volcanoes also play a vital role in renewing soil fertility and creating new landforms.

Paragraph B
There are three main types of volcanoes: shield, composite (or stratovolcano), and dome volcanoes. Each type differs in shape, eruption style, and composition of lava.

Shield volcanoes, such as those in Hawaii, are broad and gently sloping. They form from fluid lava that can travel long distances before cooling, producing frequent but relatively mild eruptions.

Composite volcanoes, like Japan’s Mount Fuji or Italy’s Mount Vesuvius, are tall, steep, and built from alternating layers of ash and lava. Their eruptions can be highly explosive and dangerous.

Dome volcanoes form when thick, sticky lava piles near the vent rather than flowing away. They tend to erupt less often but can produce powerful blasts when pressure builds.

Paragraph C
Volcanic activity varies depending on factors such as magma temperature, gas content, and the type of plate boundary involved. For example, at divergent boundaries — where plates move apart — magma rises easily, leading to calm eruptions that create new oceanic crust. In contrast, at convergent boundaries — where one plate slides beneath another — magma becomes trapped under pressure, often causing violent explosions. The infamous eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980 was a classic example of this.

Paragraph D
Scientists monitor volcanoes using satellites, seismographs, and gas sensors to predict eruptions and reduce risk. Despite progress, accurate forecasting remains difficult because each volcano behaves differently. Early warning systems, evacuation drills, and hazard maps are critical tools for protecting nearby communities.

Paragraph E
Volcanoes also contribute significantly to the planet’s ecosystem. Ash and minerals enrich the soil, supporting agriculture in many developing countries. For instance, rice grown in volcanic soils of Indonesia and coffee from volcanic regions of Central America are globally famous for their quality. However, the same fertile regions often face the constant danger of eruption — a delicate balance between benefit and risk.

Here’s your full, IELTS-style passage (~760 words), questions, answers, and explanation.

📘 IELTS Reading Practice – Passage 8
Question Type: Choose a Title
Title: The Discovery of Penicillin
Reading Passage

Paragraph A
In 1928, a Scottish scientist named Alexander Fleming made an observation that would change the course of modern medicine. While studying Staphylococcus bacteria in his London laboratory, Fleming noticed that one of his Petri dishes had been contaminated by a mould. Surprisingly, the bacteria surrounding the mould had been destroyed, while colonies farther away remained intact. Fleming concluded that the mould must have produced a substance capable of killing bacteria — a finding that marked the beginning of the antibiotic era.

Paragraph B
The mould responsible for this effect was later identified as Penicillium notatum, and the substance it produced was named penicillin. Fleming’s initial discovery was accidental, but his scientific curiosity and careful observation enabled him to recognize its significance. However, he was unable to extract and purify penicillin in large quantities, as it was unstable and broke down easily outside laboratory conditions.

Paragraph C
For more than a decade, Fleming’s discovery remained largely unnoticed. It was not until the early 1940s that a team of researchers at the University of Oxford — led by Howard Florey, Ernst Chain, and Norman Heatley — successfully developed methods to mass-produce penicillin. Their innovation came at a critical time: World War II had created an urgent need for effective treatments for infected wounds and diseases such as pneumonia and syphilis.

Paragraph D
Producing penicillin on an industrial scale was a major scientific and logistical challenge. The Oxford group partnered with American pharmaceutical companies to design large fermentation tanks capable of growing Penicillium mould efficiently. By 1944, factories in the United States were producing enough penicillin to supply Allied troops, saving countless lives on the battlefield.

Paragraph E
The introduction of penicillin marked the dawn of the antibiotic revolution. For the first time, doctors could cure infections that had previously been fatal. Diseases such as meningitis, gonorrhea, and rheumatic fever could now be treated effectively. The success of penicillin inspired the discovery of other antibiotics, transforming healthcare and dramatically increasing life expectancy in the 20th century.

Paragraph F
Yet, as with many scientific breakthroughs, penicillin’s impact came with unintended consequences. Decades of overuse and misuse have led to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, rendering some treatments ineffective. The World Health Organization now considers antimicrobial resistance one of the greatest threats to global health. Ironically, the very discovery that once saved millions of lives may pose a new danger to humanity if antibiotics lose their power.

Paragraph G
Despite this growing concern, scientists continue to search for new antibiotics and alternative treatments, such as bacteriophage therapy and genetic engineering. Fleming himself had predicted this problem; in his 1945 Nobel Prize speech, he warned that careless use of penicillin could lead to resistance. His words remain just as relevant today, reminding us that progress in medicine must always be balanced with responsibility.

Question
Choose the most suitable title for the passage from the list below.

A. The Life and Work of Alexander Fleming
B. The Dangers of Overusing Antibiotics
C. Penicillin: A Discovery that Changed Medicine
D. World War II and the Growth of Pharmaceutical Companies
E. The Process of Making Mould-Based Drugs

✅ Answer: C — Penicillin: A Discovery that Changed Medicine
Explanation
Option	Evaluation
A	Too narrow — focuses only on Fleming, but the passage includes Florey, Chain, WWII production, and modern consequences.
B	Partial — only last two paragraphs discuss antibiotic resistance, not the main idea.
C ✅	Best — captures the entire story arc: discovery, development, impact, and legacy of penicillin.
D	Incorrect — WWII is part of the story, but not the main focus.
E	Too technical and limited — passage is about discovery and consequences, not just manufacturing.
💡 Tricks for “Choose a Title”

📘 IELTS Reading Practice – Passage 9
Question Type: Short Answer Questions
Title: The Global Water Crisis
Reading Passage

Paragraph A
Water covers more than 70 percent of the Earth’s surface, yet only a tiny fraction is drinkable. Around 97 percent of all water is saltwater found in oceans, and another 2 percent is locked in glaciers and ice caps. This means that less than 1 percent of the planet’s freshwater is available for human use — stored in rivers, lakes, and underground aquifers. Despite this scarcity, global demand for water continues to grow as populations expand and industries develop.

Paragraph B
According to the United Nations, nearly two billion people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water. The problem is most severe in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where infrastructure is weak and rainfall is unpredictable. In some regions, women and children spend hours each day collecting water, limiting their opportunities for education and employment.

Paragraph C
Agriculture is by far the largest consumer of water, accounting for roughly 70 percent of global freshwater use. Inefficient irrigation systems, combined with water-intensive crops like rice and cotton, often lead to massive waste. In contrast, modern techniques such as drip irrigation can cut water usage by more than half while maintaining or even increasing crop yields.

Paragraph D
Industrial activity also contributes to the crisis. Factories require large volumes of water for cooling, cleaning, and processing. In developing countries, untreated industrial waste is often released directly into rivers, contaminating supplies used for drinking and farming. Toxic substances such as mercury and lead can persist in the environment for decades, causing serious health problems.

Paragraph E
Climate change is worsening the situation. Rising temperatures accelerate evaporation and alter rainfall patterns, leading to more frequent droughts in some areas and floods in others. Glacial melting, particularly in regions like the Himalayas and the Andes, threatens the long-term water supply of millions who depend on rivers fed by ice melt.

Paragraph F
Solutions to the water crisis require both local and global efforts. On a local level, improving infrastructure — such as building wells, water treatment plants, and storage systems — is essential. On a global scale, cooperation between countries that share rivers and aquifers can help prevent conflicts and promote fair distribution. International organizations and NGOs are also playing a vital role in funding and implementing clean-water projects.

Paragraph G
Technology is offering hope. Desalination plants, which convert seawater into freshwater, are becoming more efficient and affordable thanks to advances in membrane technology. Countries such as Israel and Saudi Arabia already rely heavily on desalination to meet their domestic water needs. Additionally, wastewater recycling — cleaning and reusing water from households and industries — is gaining acceptance as a sustainable practice in cities like Singapore.

Paragraph H
Ultimately, experts emphasize that solving the water crisis depends on changing human behavior. Reducing waste, repairing leaks, and adopting water-saving appliances are steps individuals can take immediately. Governments, on the other hand, must create policies that encourage conservation and penalize pollution. Without collective action, the gap between water supply and demand will only widen.

Questions 1–10

Answer the questions below using NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS AND/OR A NUMBER from the passage.

What percentage of Earth’s water is saltwater?

Where is most of the freshwater currently trapped?

In which regions is access to clean water especially poor?

📘 IELTS Reading Practice – Passage 10
Question Type: Sentence Completion
Title: The History of Flight
Reading Passage

Paragraph A
The dream of human flight is as old as civilization itself. Ancient myths from Greece and China tell stories of people who tried to soar like birds. However, it was not until the late 18th century that the first successful attempts at flying took place. In 1783, the Montgolfier brothers from France launched a large hot-air balloon carrying two passengers — a sheep and a duck — marking the beginning of man-made aviation.

Paragraph B
While balloons demonstrated that flight was possible, they had little control over direction or speed. The next great breakthrough came in the 19th century with the invention of gliders. German engineer Otto Lilienthal conducted over 2,000 flights using gliders of his own design, gathering valuable data about lift and air resistance. His research laid the foundation for future powered flight, although he tragically died in a crash in 1896.

Paragraph C
Inspired by Lilienthal’s work, American brothers Wilbur and Orville Wright built the first successful powered airplane in 1903. Their aircraft, the Flyer, used a lightweight engine and propeller system, achieving controlled, sustained flight for 12 seconds in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. This event is widely regarded as the birth of modern aviation.

Paragraph D
In the decades that followed, aviation advanced rapidly. During World War I, airplanes were used mainly for reconnaissance and limited combat. By the 1930s, improvements in engine power and aerodynamics allowed for longer, faster flights. Commercial airlines began to appear, connecting major cities across continents and making air travel accessible to the public for the first time.

Paragraph E
World War II further accelerated progress in aircraft design. The development of jet engines revolutionized aviation, making planes capable of flying higher and faster than ever before. After the war, jet technology quickly entered civilian use, giving rise to the era of commercial jetliners. The 1950s and 1960s saw the introduction of iconic aircraft like the Boeing 707, which could cross the Atlantic Ocean in less than eight hours.

Paragraph F
In the second half of the 20th century, humanity’s ambitions moved beyond the sky and into space. The launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik in 1957 marked the start of the Space Age, followed by Yuri Gagarin’s historic orbit around Earth in 1961. Just eight years later, in 1969, American astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first human to walk on the Moon — a defining moment in the history of flight.

Paragraph G
Today, the aviation industry continues to innovate. Modern aircraft use composite materials to reduce weight and improve fuel efficiency. Meanwhile, the development of electric and autonomous aircraft promises a future of cleaner, safer, and more sustainable air travel. Yet, the spirit of discovery that began with the Montgolfiers remains unchanged — the desire to rise above boundaries and explore new frontiers.

📘 IELTS Reading Practice – Passage 11
Question Type: Summary Completion
Title: The Renewable Energy Revolution
Reading Passage

Paragraph A
For centuries, human civilisation relied heavily on coal, oil, and natural gas to power growth and development. These fuels transformed industries and improved living standards, but they also released massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. As evidence of climate change has become undeniable, governments and scientists have turned their attention to renewable energy — power sources that can replenish naturally and emit little or no greenhouse gases.

Paragraph B
Among the most widely used renewables are solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass energy. Each offers unique advantages and limitations. Solar power, for instance, captures energy from sunlight through photovoltaic panels. Once expensive, solar technology has become dramatically cheaper over the past two decades, thanks to advances in manufacturing and efficiency.

Paragraph C
Wind energy harnesses the motion of air currents to generate electricity. Modern wind turbines can reach heights of over 200 metres, with blades longer than a Boeing 747’s wingspan. Offshore wind farms, located in the sea where winds are stronger and more consistent, now supply power to millions of homes. However, wind output can fluctuate with weather conditions, making it less predictable than fossil-fuel generation.

Paragraph D
Hydroelectricity, one of the oldest renewable sources, converts the potential energy of falling or flowing water into mechanical energy. Dams like China’s Three Gorges Dam or Brazil’s Itaipu Dam produce enormous amounts of electricity. Yet, large hydro projects can also flood valleys, displace communities, and damage ecosystems. For this reason, many countries are shifting toward smaller, run-of-river systems that have lower environmental impact.

Paragraph E
Geothermal energy, derived from the natural heat beneath the Earth’s crust, provides a constant source of power. Countries located near tectonic plate boundaries, such as Iceland and New Zealand, use it extensively for heating and electricity. Biomass energy, on the other hand, comes from organic materials such as wood, crop residues, or waste. Although considered renewable, burning biomass releases carbon dioxide, so its sustainability depends on how resources are managed.

Paragraph F
The shift to renewables is not only about environmental protection but also about energy security. Unlike fossil fuels, which are concentrated in a few regions, renewable resources are widely distributed. This allows nations to become more self-sufficient and less dependent on volatile oil markets. Furthermore, the renewable sector creates millions of new jobs in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance, offering significant economic benefits.

Paragraph G
Despite rapid progress, challenges remain. Renewable technologies require large initial investments, and energy storage systems such as batteries are still costly. Integrating intermittent sources like wind and solar into national power grids demands advanced management systems. Nevertheless, as technology improves and costs fall, the world is steadily moving toward a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.

📘 IELTS Reading Practice – Passage 12
Question Type: Table Completion
Title: World Population Trends
Reading Passage

Paragraph A
Human population growth has changed dramatically over the past two centuries. For most of history, global population increased very slowly, limited by food supply, disease, and conflict. Around the year 1800, the world’s population reached approximately 1 billion for the first time. However, the Industrial Revolution brought improved agriculture, medicine, and sanitation, which led to a sharp decline in death rates and a surge in population growth.

Paragraph B
By 1950, the global population had more than doubled to 2.5 billion, and by 2000, it had reached 6 billion. Today, the world is home to over 8 billion people. The United Nations projects that by 2050, population will exceed 9.7 billion. Most of this growth will occur in developing regions, particularly Africa and South Asia, where fertility rates remain high and healthcare is improving.

Paragraph C
In contrast, many developed countries are facing population decline. Nations such as Japan, Italy, and Germany have birth rates well below the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman. An aging population means fewer workers and greater pressure on social welfare systems. Governments in these countries are encouraging immigration and family-friendly policies to stabilize population numbers.

Paragraph D
Rapid population growth creates both challenges and opportunities. On one hand, it increases demand for food, housing, and jobs, placing enormous strain on resources. On the other, a youthful population can provide a large labor force, which—if properly educated and employed—can boost economic productivity. Economists call this the “demographic dividend.”

Paragraph E
Urbanization is another major trend shaping demographic patterns. By 2007, for the first time in history, more people lived in cities than in rural areas. Megacities like Tokyo, Delhi, and Lagos now have populations exceeding 20 million. While urban centers often offer better access to education and healthcare, they also face severe challenges, including congestion, pollution, and inadequate housing.

Paragraph F
Looking ahead, population growth is expected to slow down gradually as fertility rates decline worldwide. The UN predicts that global population will peak around 2080 before starting to decrease. Education, especially for women, along with access to contraception, are key factors that influence family size. Ultimately, the future of humanity will depend on how effectively nations manage both population growth and decline.

💡 Tricks for ‘Table Completion’

Check the column headers — they guide what type of information to find (numbers, places, causes, etc.).

Read in order — tables usually follow the passage chronologically.

Watch for paraphrasing:

“Double” ↔ “Twice as much”

“Decline” ↔ “Fall / Drop / Decrease”

Use units carefully — e.g., “billion,” “percent,” “years.”

Don’t add your own symbols — copy what appears in the text (e.g., write “9.7 billion,” not “9.7B”).

Perfect 🍫 — now it’s time for Passage 13, which covers Flow Chart Completion, one of the most visual and logical question types in IELTS Reading.

You’ll read a step-by-step process description (~750 words), then complete a flow chart with the correct missing words (NO MORE THAN TWO or THREE WORDS each).

Let’s go 👇

📘 IELTS Reading Practice – Passage 13
Question Type: Flow Chart Completion
Title: The Chocolate-Making Process
Reading Passage

Paragraph A
Chocolate, one of the world’s most beloved treats, originates from the seeds of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao), native to Central and South America. The process of transforming bitter cacao beans into smooth, sweet chocolate involves several complex steps — each affecting flavor, texture, and quality.

Paragraph B
The journey begins with the harvesting of ripe cacao pods. Farmers typically cut the pods from the trees using long knives or machetes. Each pod contains between 20 and 50 beans surrounded by a sticky, white pulp. The beans and pulp are carefully removed and piled together for the next stage.

Paragraph C
The next crucial step is fermentation. During this process, the beans are covered with banana leaves or placed in shallow wooden boxes for several days. Natural yeasts and bacteria break down the pulp and generate heat, which changes the beans’ color from pale to dark brown. Fermentation is essential for developing the beans’ characteristic chocolate flavor.

Paragraph D
After fermentation, the beans are dried — usually by spreading them out under the sun for about a week. Drying prevents mould growth and reduces moisture content to around 7%. In some countries, mechanical dryers are used when weather conditions are unsuitable. Once dried, the beans are packed into sacks and shipped to chocolate manufacturers around the world.

Paragraph E
At the factory, the beans are first cleaned and roasted. Roasting further enhances flavor and aroma while making it easier to remove the outer shell. The remaining inner part, called the nib, contains the cocoa solids and butter that form the basis of chocolate.

Paragraph F
Next, the nibs are ground into a thick paste known as chocolate liquor — although it contains no alcohol. This liquor can then be pressed to separate cocoa butter from cocoa powder, or blended with sugar, milk, and additional cocoa butter to make eating chocolate.

Paragraph G
The blended mixture is then refined and conched, a process that kneads the chocolate under heat for several hours or even days. This step smooths out the texture and releases desirable flavors by allowing volatile acids to evaporate. The longer the conching, the higher the quality of the final product.

Paragraph H
Before being moulded into bars or other shapes, the chocolate must be tempered — a careful heating and cooling process that stabilizes the cocoa butter crystals. Tempering gives chocolate its glossy appearance and satisfying snap when broken. Once cooled and packaged, the final product is ready to be shipped to stores around the globe.

Questions 1–10

Complete the flow chart below.
Use NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS from the passage for each answer.

💡 Tricks for ‘Flow Chart Completion’

Follow the process order — IELTS always arranges process steps chronologically.

Predict word type: e.g., “are ___” → needs a past participle.

Watch for verbs of action — harvest, ferment, roast, grind, etc.

Answers are usually nouns or verbs, never full clauses.

If there’s a sequence, underline time words (“then,” “after,” “next,” etc.).

📘 IELTS Reading Practice – Passage 14
Question Type: Diagram / Note Completion
Title: The Structure of the Human Heart
Reading Passage

Paragraph A
The human heart is a powerful muscular organ roughly the size of a fist. It is located slightly to the left of the chest and serves as the body’s circulatory pump, delivering oxygen and nutrients to tissues while removing carbon dioxide and waste products. The heart beats about 100,000 times a day, circulating roughly 7,000 liters of blood through an intricate network of blood vessels.

Paragraph B
The heart consists of four chambers: two upper atria and two lower ventricles. The right side of the heart handles deoxygenated blood, while the left side handles oxygenated blood. A thick wall of muscle called the septum divides the two sides, preventing any mixing between oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood.

Paragraph C
Blood enters the heart through two large veins: the superior and inferior vena cava, which carry deoxygenated blood from the body into the right atrium. When the right atrium contracts, the blood passes through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. From there, it is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs, where carbon dioxide is released and oxygen is absorbed.

Paragraph D
Oxygenated blood returns from the lungs via the pulmonary veins into the left atrium. It then flows through the mitral (bicuspid) valve into the left ventricle, the thickest and strongest chamber of the heart. When the left ventricle contracts, it sends blood into the aorta, the largest artery in the body, which distributes oxygen-rich blood to every organ and tissue.

Paragraph E
The opening and closing of valves ensure that blood flows in only one direction, preventing backflow. These valves — tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, and aortic — act like gates, opening and shutting in precise coordination with each heartbeat. The rhythmic beating of the heart is controlled by electrical impulses from the sinoatrial (SA) node, often referred to as the heart’s natural pacemaker.

Paragraph F
In addition to its mechanical function, the heart’s health depends on lifestyle factors. Regular exercise strengthens the cardiac muscles, while a diet low in saturated fat helps maintain open arteries. Conversely, habits such as smoking, excessive alcohol intake, and chronic stress can contribute to heart disease, one of the leading causes of death globally.

Questions 1–5

Blood first enters through the ________.

Blood leaves the right ventricle via the ________.

Oxygenated blood flows into the ________.

Blood returns to the heart through the ________.

The left ventricle pumps blood out through the ________.

✅ Answer Key & Explanations
No.	Answer	Explanation
1	right atrium	Paragraph C – “Blood enters… into the right atrium.”
2	pulmonary artery	Paragraph C – “Pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs.”
3	left atrium	Paragraph D – “Oxygenated blood returns… into the left atrium.”
4	pulmonary veins	Paragraph D – “Returns from the lungs via the pulmonary veins.”
5	aorta	Paragraph D – “Sends blood into the aorta, the largest artery in the body.”
💡 Tricks for ‘Diagram / Map / Note Completion’

Study the diagram first — know which direction the flow or structure moves.

Look for naming patterns — e.g., “veins bring blood to the heart,” “arteries carry blood away.”

Watch synonyms:

“Carries blood out of” ↔ “pumps blood through.”

“Enters” ↔ “flows into.”

Answers follow logical order — top to bottom or left to right.

Spelling counts — anatomy terms must be exact (e.g., atrium, aorta).
