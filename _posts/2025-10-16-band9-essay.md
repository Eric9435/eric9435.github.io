#  How to Write a Band 9 IELTS Essay — Technical Style Guide

##  Overview
Band 9 writing is not just about vocabulary — it’s about **technical precision**, **logical design**, and **academic tone**.  
This guide explains how to think, write, and structure your essay like a professional analyst, not a student.

---

##  1️⃣ Think Like an Examiner

| Criterion | Technical Question to Ask Yourself |
|------------|------------------------------------|
| **Task Response** | Have I answered *every part* of the question with a clear stance? |
| **Coherence & Cohesion** | Do my ideas connect logically — cause → effect → implication? |
| **Lexical Resource** | Can I replace common words with precise, academic alternatives? |
| **Grammatical Range & Accuracy** | Is my structure complex but still natural and clear? |

💡 *Goal:* You are not “writing an essay” — you are **demonstrating linguistic control** and academic reasoning.

---

##  2️⃣ Core Features of Band 9 Technical Style

| Feature | Function | Example |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Nominalisation** | Turns verbs/adjectives into nouns for density | *Diplomats negotiated → The **negotiation** between diplomats* |
| **Passive or Impersonal Voice** | Keeps tone formal and objective | *It is widely believed that...* |
| **Embedded Clauses** | Adds information precisely | *Sanctions, **which are often broad in scope**, may harm civilians.* |
| **Complex Sentence Variety** | Blends subordination and emphasis | *Were diplomacy more transparent, trust might grow.* |
| **Thematic Progression** | Ends each sentence with an idea picked up by the next | *This trust fosters cooperation. Cooperation, in turn, sustains peace.* |
| **Abstract Lexis** | Replaces emotional with conceptual language | *peace → stability / deterrence / reconciliation* |
| **Cohesive Precision** | Logical connectors used sparingly | *Nevertheless, Consequently, By contrast, Ultimately* |

---

##  3️⃣ Syntax Engineering Tools

| Device | Purpose | Example |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Inversion** | Adds emphasis and formality | *Rarely has diplomacy been so crucial to stability.* |
| **Cleft Sentence** | Focuses on contrast or key element | *It is not coercion but communication that achieves peace.* |
| **Parallelism** | Creates rhythm and balance | *morally defensible and strategically sustainable.* |
| **Participial Reduction** | Compresses clauses elegantly | *Having signed the treaty, both sides withdrew troops.* |
| **Nominal Chain** | Packs abstract meaning | *the implementation of verification mechanisms.* |

---

##  4️⃣ Sentence-Level Technical Design

Every Band 9 sentence contains three elements:

1. **Abstract subject** (concept, not person)  
2. **Process verb** (academic action word)  
3. **Result or qualifier**

**Example:**
> *Diplomacy **facilitates reciprocal concessions**, thereby **enhancing regional stability.***

💬 Each component carries analytical weight — no filler words.

---

##  5️⃣ Paragraph Structure — The C.E.E.R. Model

> **C – Claim** → **E – Explanation** → **E – Evidence** → **R – Result**

**Example:**
1. *Claim:* Sanctions can restrain aggression.  
2. *Explanation:* They restrict access to critical resources.  
3. *Evidence:* For example, Iran’s oil exports dropped by 40%.  
4. *Result:* Consequently, negotiations resumed within months.

💡 Each sentence drives logic forward — never repeats or circles back.

---

##  6️⃣ Lexical Precision Upgrades

| Common Word | Technical Equivalent |
|--------------|----------------------|
| make better | **enhance / optimise / strengthen** |
| make worse | **exacerbate / undermine / erode** |
| say / show | **indicate / illustrate / demonstrate** |
| problem | **challenge / constraint / obstacle** |
| people | **stakeholders / actors / citizens / participants** |
| good | **beneficial / advantageous / constructive** |
| bad | **detrimental / adverse / undesirable** |

---

##  7️⃣ Band 9 Grammar & Density Metrics

| Measure | Ideal Band 9 Target |
|----------|--------------------|
| Clauses per sentence | 2–3 average |
| Abstract nouns | ≥ 10% of total words |
| Academic verbs | ≥ 8% of total words |
| Subordinate conjunctions | 1 every 2 sentences |
| Grammar / spelling errors | 0 (only slips allowed) |
| Sentence variety | At least 5 complex forms |

---

##  8️⃣ Example: Technical Transformation

| Band 7 Sentence | Band 9 Rewrite |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Diplomacy helps countries work together. | **Diplomacy facilitates inter-state cooperation by institutionalising dialogue mechanisms.** |
| Sanctions stop wars. | **Economic sanctions function as coercive instruments that elevate the strategic cost of aggression.** |
| Talking is better than fighting. | **Negotiation constitutes a non-violent framework for conflict resolution.** |

💬 *Notice:* Nominalisation, advanced verbs, and conceptual nouns replace simple structures.

---

##  9️⃣ Tone & Register Rules

- ❌ Avoid contractions (*can’t, don’t*) → ✅ use full forms (*cannot, do not*).  
- ❌ Avoid emotional adjectives (*terrible, amazing*) → ✅ use analytical ones (*significant, severe, complex*).  
- ✅ Prefer verbs of reasoning: *suggests, implies, demonstrates, indicates*.  
- ✅ Use hedging when needed: *arguably, to some extent, tends to*.  
- ✅ Maintain objectivity: no personal “I think” unless explicitly required.

---

☑ Abstract and topic-specific vocabulary  
☑ Logical connectors used sparingly

##  Final Recap — The Band 9 Technical Mindset

| Principle | Description |
|------------|--------------|
|  **Conceptual clarity** | Discuss systems, not feelings. |
|  **Linguistic engineering** | Use syntax and lexis to compress meaning. |
|  **Analytical tone** | Always answer *why* or *how*, not just *what*. |
|  **Balanced reasoning** | Use hedging to sound objective. |
|  **Grammar as structure** | Each form (inversion, nominalisation, participial) adds logic. |
|  **Lexical precision** | One word = one clear function. |
|  **Zero error discipline** | Mechanical accuracy + stylistic control. |

# 🧾 Band 9 Writing Technical Checklist with Examples

---

## ☑ 1️⃣ Nominalisations Used Naturally
**Definition:**  
Turn verbs or adjectives into nouns to make writing formal and compact.

**Example (Before → After):**  
- *Governments should protect citizens.*  
→ **The protection of citizens must be ensured by governments.**

**Why it matters:**  
Nominalisation adds density: *protect → protection*, *develop → development*, *decide → decision*.

---

## ☑ 2️⃣ One Inversion Used
**Definition:**  
Place the auxiliary verb before the subject for emphasis or formality.

**Example:**  
> **Rarely has diplomacy played such a decisive role in global stability.**

**Pattern:**  
*Negative / limiting adverb* + auxiliary + subject + main verb.  
e.g. *Never have I seen … / Hardly did they realise …*

**Function:**  
Highlights importance and creates professional tone.

---

## ☑ 3️⃣ One Cleft Sentence Used
**Definition:**  
Use *It is / was … that / who …* to focus attention on one part of the sentence.

**Example:**  
> **It is not coercion but communication that achieves lasting peace.**

**Pattern:**  
*It is (not) + focus + that + rest of clause.*

**Function:**  
Creates contrast and emphasis smoothly — common in Band 9 conclusions.

---

## ☑ 4️⃣ One Participial Clause Used
**Definition:**  
Compress a subordinate clause into *-ing*, *-ed*, or *having + past participle*.

**Example:**  
> **Having secured a ceasefire, negotiators initiated talks on long-term cooperation.**

**Pattern:**  
*Having + past participle* (shows sequence)  
*Built in 2010, the bridge …* (background)  
*Using AI, researchers improved accuracy.* (simultaneous action)

**Function:**  
Increases fluency and variety without extra conjunctions.

---

## ☑ 5️⃣ Abstract and Topic-Specific Vocabulary
**Definition:**  
Use conceptual nouns and domain lexis instead of general words.

**Example:**  
> **Effective diplomacy requires reciprocity, verification, and proportionality.**

**Other domains:**  
- Education → *curriculum reform, learner autonomy*  
- Environment → *carbon mitigation, ecosystem resilience*  
- Technology → *data governance, algorithmic transparency*

**Function:**  
Demonstrates lexical depth and topic awareness.

---

## ☑ 6️⃣ Logical Connectors Used Sparingly
**Definition:**  
Link ideas naturally; avoid overusing “Firstly, Secondly, In conclusion”.

**Example:**  
> **Sanctions can deter aggression; nevertheless, they often harm civilians.**  
> **By contrast, dialogue fosters trust between rival states.**

**High-level connectors:** *Nevertheless, Conversely, Consequently, By contrast, Ultimately.*

**Function:**  
Cohesion appears seamless, not forced.

---

## ☑ 7️⃣ Paragraphs Follow the C-E-E-R Model
**Definition:**  
Each paragraph develops one clear idea:
> **Claim → Explanation → Evidence → Result**

**Example Paragraph:**
> **Claim:** Economic sanctions can restrain aggression.  
> **Explanation:** They limit access to global finance and technology.  
> **Evidence:** For instance, restrictions on exports reduced arms supplies by 30 %.  
> **Result:** Consequently, warring parties returned to negotiations.

**Function:**  
Keeps argument logical and complete — a key Band 9 hallmark.

---

## ☑ 8️⃣ Tone Formal and Impersonal
**Definition:**  
No personal opinions, emotions, or contractions.

**Example:**  
❌ *I think diplomacy is better than war.*  
✅ **Diplomacy is widely regarded as a more sustainable approach to conflict resolution.**

**Signs of proper tone:**  
- No *I*, *we*, *you*  
- No slang or informal intensifiers (*really, very, a lot*)  
- Use impersonal phrases (*It is widely believed that…*)

---

## ☑ 9️⃣ No Language Errors or Informal Phrasing
**Definition:**  
Grammar, spelling, and punctuation are flawless; diction stays academic.

**Example:**  
❌ *Many people doesn’t agree with this idea.*  
✅ **Many people do not agree with this proposition.**

**Quick self-check:**  
- Subject–verb agreement? ✅  
- Article usage correct? ✅  
- Formal vocabulary? ✅  
- Commas after introductory phrases? ✅
